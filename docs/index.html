          <strong>HOW TO EARN CRYPTO</strong>
          <h1>Earn interest from your crypto savings.</h1>
          <p>
            Your crypto can earn up to 10.5% APY in crypto with a Interest
            Account (BIA). Interest accrues daily and is paid weekly or monthly.
            There are no hidden fees, no minimum balances, and no reason to
            wait.

            <strong>Definition</strong> CeFi, short for centralized finance,
            offers some of the yield benefits of DeFi with some of the ease of
            use and security of traditional financial-services products. With
            CeFi, you can earn interest on savings, borrow money, spend with a
            crypto debit card, and more.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            One of crypto’s core concepts is “decentralization” — which allows
            transactions between strangers anywhere in the world to be conducted
            without any kind of institution in the middle. DeFi (short for
            decentralized finance) takes that idea the farthest. It’s an entire
            ecosystem of smart-contract powered apps that make it possible to
            lend, save, trade, and more — all without any kind of bank or
            payment processor in the middle.
          </p>
          <p>
            But because DeFi is an emerging technology, it comes with a set of
            unique risks. Navigating DeFi protocols requires a relatively strong
            level of technical knowledge and comfort with the potential for
            losing some of all of your investment in the case of buggy code,
            malicious actors, or even simple user error.
          </p>
          <p>
            CeFi, as you’ve probably guessed, stands for “centralized finance.”
            The core idea behind CeFi is to create crypto investment
            opportunities that offer some of the yield benefits of DeFi with
            some of the ease of use and security of traditional
            financial-services products (sometimes referred to as TradFi). With
            CeFi, you can borrow money, buy and sell crypto, spend and earn
            rewards with a crypto debit card, and more.
          </p>
          <h2 id="how-do-you-earn-yield">How do you earn yield with CeFi?</h2>
          <p>
            CeFi creates the potential for earning yield via crypto-based
            accounts that are functionally similar to a traditional bank’s
            savings accounts — but may offer substantially higher returns.
            Unlike conventional savings accounts, crypto deposits aren’t
            currently eligible for government-backed FDIC or SIPC insurance so
            you should make sure to understand the risks involved. Coinbase,
            however, does offer a principal guarantee on the USDC you deposit
            for CeFi lending.
          </p>
          <p>
            The general concept involves holding some of your crypto on one of
            the many platforms that offer this kind of product. Via Coinbase,
            US-based customers in many states can now sign up for a waitlist to
            start earning an annual yield of 4% for holding USD Coin (USDC).
          </p>
          <h2 id="where-does-the-yield-come-from">
            Where does the yield come from?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Some or all of your crypto holdings are put to work and lent out to
            others. These borrowers pay the centralized provider an interest
            rate for borrowing, and that provider passes on some of the interest
            to you.
          </p>
          <h2 id="how-does-cefi-borrowing-connect">
            How does CeFi borrowing connect to CeFi lending/saving?
          </h2>
          <p>
            CeFi makes it possible to borrow money against your crypto holdings,
            the same way you’d use traditional assets as collateral to apply for
            a bank loan. It’s the flip side of lending — the interest users pay
            for borrowing money is where the yield you can earn for holding
            crypto via CeFi is generated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike bank loans, CeFi loans typically require little or no
            paperwork. Via Coinbase, US-based customers in many states can
            borrow up to $100,000 without a credit check.
          </p>
          <h2 id="what-are-some-cefi-risks">What are some CeFi risks?</h2>
          <p>
            Each CeFi product and provider is unique and may put your deposited
            crypto to work in ways that have higher or lower levels of risk.
            It’s important to do your homework and understand how your crypto is
            being used, how the yield you’re earning is generated, and what
            risks are entailed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember: crypto deposits aren’t currently eligible for the
            government-backed insurance that protects savings held by a
            traditional bank. (That said, Coinbase’s CeFi lending product offers
            a principal guarantee.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Some CeFi providers might lock up your principal for a period of
            time. Coinbase, however, allows you to access your USDC at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            All stablecoins aren’t created equal. For example, USDC is based on
            open-source code that anyone can scrutinize. USDC is backed by
            dollar-denominated assets of at least equal fair value to the USDC
            in circulation, in segregated accounts with US regulated financial
            institutions. You can buy USDC via exchanges like Coinbase, and hold
            it in any Ethereum compatible wallet. There are no fees for
            transferring a US dollar to USDC. The launch of USDC was powered by
            a collaboration between Coinbase and Circle through the co-founding
            of the CENTRE Consortium.
