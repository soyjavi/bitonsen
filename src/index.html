            Your crypto can earn up to 12% APY with an Interest Account. Interest accrues daily and is paid weekly or
            monthly. There are no hidden fees, no minimum balances, and no reason to wait.

            CeFi, short for centralized finance, offers some of the yield benefits of DeFi with some of the ease of use
            and security of traditional financial-services products. With CeFi, you can earn interest on savings, borrow
            money, spend with a crypto debit card, and more.
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            One of crypto’s core concepts is “decentralization” — which allows transactions between strangers anywhere
            in the world to be conducted without any kind of institution in the middle. DeFi (short for decentralized
            finance) takes that idea the farthest. It’s an entire ecosystem of smart-contract powered apps that make it
            possible to lend, save, trade, and more — all without any kind of bank or payment processor in the middle.
          </p>
          <p>
            But because DeFi is an emerging technology, it comes with a set of unique risks. Navigating DeFi protocols
            requires a relatively strong level of technical knowledge and comfort with the potential for losing some of
            all of your investment in the case of buggy code, malicious actors, or even simple user error.
          </p>
          <p>
            CeFi, as you’ve probably guessed, stands for “centralized finance.” The core idea behind CeFi is to create
            crypto investment opportunities that offer some of the yield benefits of DeFi with some of the ease of use
            and security of traditional financial-services products (sometimes referred to as TradFi). With CeFi, you
            can borrow money, buy and sell crypto, spend and earn rewards with a crypto debit card, and more.
          </p>

          <h2 id="how-do-you-earn-yield">How do you earn yield with CeFi?</h2>
          <p>
            CeFi creates the potential for earning yield via crypto-based accounts that are functionally similar to a
            traditional bank’s savings accounts — but may offer substantially higher returns. Unlike conventional
            savings accounts, crypto deposits aren’t currently eligible for government-backed FDIC or SIPC insurance so
            you should make sure to understand the risks involved. The general concept involves holding some of your
            crypto on one of the many platforms that offer this kind of product.
          </p>

          <h2 id="where-does-the-yield-come-from">Where does the yield come from?</h2>
          <p>
            Some or all of your crypto holdings are put to work and lent out to others. These borrowers pay the
            centralized provider an interest rate for borrowing, and that provider passes on some of the interest to
            you.
          </p>

          <h2 id="how-does-cefi-borrowing-connect">How does CeFi borrowing connect to CeFi lending/saving?</h2>
          <p>
            CeFi makes it possible to borrow money against your crypto holdings, the same way you’d use traditional
            assets as collateral to apply for a bank loan. It’s the flip side of lending — the interest users pay for
            borrowing money is where the yield you can earn for holding crypto via CeFi is generated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike bank loans, CeFi loans typically require little or no paperwork. Normally customers can borrow up to
            $100,000 without a credit check.
          </p>

          <h2 id="what-are-some-cefi-risks">What are some CeFi risks?</h2>
          <p>
            Each CeFi product and provider is unique and may put your deposited crypto to work in ways that have higher
            or lower levels of risk. It’s important to do your homework and understand how your crypto is being used,
            how the yield you’re earning is generated, and what risks are entailed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember: crypto deposits aren’t currently eligible for the government-backed insurance that protects
            savings held by a traditional bank.
          </p>
          <p>
            All stablecoins aren’t created equal. For example, USDT is based on open-source code that anyone can
            scrutinize. USDT is backed by dollar-denominated assets of at least equal fair value to the USDT in
            circulation, in segregated accounts with US regulated financial institutions. You can buy USDT via exchanges
            like Coinbase, and hold it in any Ethereum compatible wallet. There are no fees for transferring a US dollar
            to USDT.
